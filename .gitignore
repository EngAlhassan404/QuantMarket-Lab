This file tells Git which files and folders to ignore.
It's crucial for keeping the repository clean and professional.
Python cache files
pycache/
*.pyc
*.pyo
*.pyd

Virtual environment folders
venv/
.venv/

Local user-generated results
This ensures that only the curated 'case_study_results' are tracked by Git,
not the user's own generated analysis files.
/results/*

Backups folder
Backups are for local recovery and should not be part of the repository.
/_Backups/*

Data folders
It's good practice to ignore large data files.
Users will generate their own data by running the acquisition pipeline.
This keeps the repository lightweight.
/data/raw/
/data/processed/
